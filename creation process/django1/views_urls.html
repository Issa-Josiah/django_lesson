    <h1>VIEWS,URLS AND  TEMPLATES</h1>
    <h2>Views</h2>
    <h3>Creating Views</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      To create views one must first create an app. To do this refer to the
      procedure below
    </p>
    <iframe
      src="creating_app.html"
      frameborder="0"
      width="70%" height="400px"
    ></iframe>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Go to the views.py to write views. Views pass on request and get
      responsse. This is the basic function of a server. A view must always take
      in a request and return a response object. Either a redirect or a render or a 
      Httpresponse object.
    </p>
    <h5>example of views using Httpresponse</h5>
    <p>An example while using htto response is done below</p>

    <p>Remember writting the viewss is part of the pie. In order to display it we need to redirect it from the urls.py folder</p>
    
    
    <!-- urls.py -->
    <h2>Urls</h2>
    <h3>Creating Urls</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p><mark>urls.py only create the channels to get the page</mark></p>
    <p>
      To create urls one must first go to the urls.py file in the app folder.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <p>Then import the views from the views.py file.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
      After that create a list of
      url patterns and map them to the views created in the views.py file.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Finally go to the main(one) urls.py file in the project folder and include the
      app urls.py file.Also you have to import include from django.urls
    </p>
    <h5>example of main urls.py including app urls.py</h5>
    <img src="one_urls1.png" alt="A picture of main urls including app">
    <h4>Step 5</h4>

    <p>Now run the server and go to the browser to see the result</p>
    <img src="results.png" alt="A picture of the result in the browser">
    <p>Great now we have a working Django application!</p>

    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <h3>Creating Templates</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      To create templates one must first create a folder named templates in the
      app folder.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Then create an HTML file inside the templates folder.Name it indx.html
    </p>
    <img src="folder1.png" alt="A picture of templates folder">
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Finally, in the views.py file, use the render function to return the template.
    </p>
    <h5>example of views.py rendering the template</h5>
    <img src="views2.png" alt="A picture of views rendering template">
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Next is to update the urls with the new changes of the new function</p>
    <h5>example of urls.py mapping to the new view function</h5>
    <img src="urls2.png" alt="A picture of urls mapping to new view">
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>To render you must make the settings.py recognize the template and the app so add the app among the installed app</p>
    <h5>example of settings.py including the app</h5>
    <img src="settings1.png" alt="A picture of settings including the app">
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Now run the server and go to the browser to see the result</p>
    <img src="template_result.png" alt="A picture of the template result in the browser">
    <p>Great now we have a working Django application with template rendering!</p>
